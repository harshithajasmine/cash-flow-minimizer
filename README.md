## Cash Flow Minimiser - Effective Breakdown

This document explains a program called Cash Flow Minimiser, designed to help groups split expenses efficiently. Let's break down its functionalities:

**Purpose:**

* Helps friends or colleagues settle shared expenses.
* Minimizes the number of transactions needed for reimbursement.

**Demo & Resources:**

* Demo: [https://cash-flow-minimizer.vercel.app/](https://cash-flow-minimizer.vercel.app/)
* Video Tutorial (Optional): [link to video tutorial]

**Installation (if applicable):**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mittal-parth/Cash-Flow-Minmiser
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Cash-Flow-Minmiser
   ```
3. Verify package.json scripts (if using npm):
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```
4. Delete `node_modules` and lock files (e.g., `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`).
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Start the server (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**How it Works:**

1. **Data Input:** 
   - The program gathers information about all transactions within the group.

2. **Calculating Net Balances:**
   - A function calculates the net balance (money owed or received) for each person.

3. **Categorizing Participants:**
   - People are divided into two categories based on their net balance:
      - **Creditors:** Positive net balance (money owed to them).
      - **Debtors:** Negative net balance (money they owe).

4. **Settlement Process:**
   - The program uses a Max Heap data structure to prioritize settlements.
   - It iteratively performs the following steps:
      1. Selects the debtor with the **largest negative balance**.
      2. Selects the creditor with the **largest positive balance**.
      3. Settles their debt by transferring money from the debtor to the creditor (up to the amount needed).
      4. Updates their net balances in the system.
   - This process continues until everyone's net balance becomes zero (fully settled).

**Benefits:**

- Simplifies expense management within groups.
- Minimizes the number of transactions required, saving time and effort.

**Additional Notes:**

- This explanation assumes a basic understanding of data structures like Max Heap.
- The provided video tutorial (if available) might offer a more visual explanation.

**Improvements:**

- Consider adding a section on user interface (UI) aspects for user interaction.
- Briefly mention limitations or future improvements (e.g., handling complex scenarios).
